# üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap ‚Äî Reddit ‚Üí Lemmy Bridge

This roadmap outlines the progressive development stages for the Reddit-to-Lemmy mirroring bridge.  
Each stage builds upon the previous one, focusing on long-term reliability, transparency, and ease of deployment.

---

## üß© Stage 1 ‚Äî Stability & Core Features ‚úÖ *(Completed)*

- **Token Management**
  - Cached login tokens for persistent sessions  
  - Automatic refresh and rate-limit cooldown logic  
- **Mapping Persistence**
  - Persistent post and community mapping (originally `post_map.json`, now migrated to SQLite)  
  - Automatic refresh every 6 hours or on demand  
- **Error Recovery**
  - Graceful token invalidation handling  
  - Retry logic with cooldowns to avoid duplicate-token errors  
- **Test Mode**
  - Toggle `TEST_MODE=true` in `.env` for dry-run verification  
  - Posts ‚ÄúExample mirrored post‚Äù instead of live Reddit content  
- **Case-Insensitive Resolution**
  - Community lookup normalized for consistent matching across instances  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stage 2 ‚Äî UX, Diagnostics & Persistence *(Completed / In Progress)*

- **SQLite Backend Cache**
  - Replaces JSON maps for posts/comments with `bridge_cache.db`  
  - Automatic migration from legacy JSON files on startup  
  - Enables duplicate-prevention and resumable sync after restart  
- **Advanced Logging**
  - Structured, timestamped logs with per-cycle summaries  
  - Optional verbose mode via `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`  
- **Diagnostics**
  - Planned `/status` and `/health` endpoints for live container monitoring  
  - Integration hooks for lightweight dashboards (Stage 3)  
- **Improved Docker Integration**
  - Updated to Python 3.12 base image  
  - Uses `/app/data` for persistent runtime state and caching  
  - Non-root container execution for improved security  

---

## üåê Stage 3 ‚Äî Health Dashboard & Queue System *(In Design)*

- **Web Dashboard**
  - Lightweight Flask/FastAPI interface for health, stats, and manual actions  
  - Displays:
    - Total mirrored posts/comments  
    - Lemmy rate-limit state  
    - JWT expiration countdown  
    - Queue backlog and errors  
- **Queue System**
  - Local retry queue for failed or deferred posts/comments  
  - Optional exponential backoff retry logic  
- **Metrics Export**
  - JSON or Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint for external monitoring  

---

## üì¶ Stage 4 ‚Äî Federation Awareness & Automation *(Planned)*

- **Remote Community Support**
  - Recognize and post to federated communities via `!community@domain`  
  - Handle propagation delays gracefully  
- **Scheduled Tasks**
  - Built-in job scheduling for periodic refresh and cleanup  
- **Maintenance CLI**
  - Add standalone management commands:
    - `--clean-db` ‚Üí clear or vacuum SQLite safely  
    - `--refresh-map` ‚Üí rebuild community mappings  
    - `--rebuild-tokens` ‚Üí force JWT renewal  
- **Federation Logging**
  - Track posts routed through remote instances with detailed metrics  

---

## üß† Stage 5 ‚Äî Smart Syncing & Analytics *(Future Goals)*

- **Performance**
  - Optimize multi-threaded or asyncio-based mirroring  
  - Adaptive pacing based on Lemmy instance load  
- **Analytics**
  - Track mirrored posts, errors, latency, and retries per cycle  
  - Export to Prometheus or Grafana for visualization  
- **Self-Healing**
  - Detect and retry broken states automatically  
  - Optional alerting via webhook or email  

---

## üí° Long-Term Vision

To evolve the Reddit‚ÄìLemmy Bridge into a fully autonomous synchronization service that:
- Self-heals after errors or restarts  
- Adapts to rate limits dynamically  
- Provides live operational transparency  
- Offers optional UI/metrics layers  
- Serves as a general-purpose Lemmy integration framework
